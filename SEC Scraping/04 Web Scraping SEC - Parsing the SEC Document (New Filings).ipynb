Technically, we could have done some of this cleaning up above but for organization purpsoes I decided to just loop through everythin again and parse it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would obviously, increase the amount of time it will take to run your code but it is easier to follow. I will provide a more \"optimized\" script that will do the cleaning up above and store that on GitHub. Another drawback to this method, is that I have to pass through all the code for each page back through BeautifulSoup. The reason why is because the tags, have been slightly messed up during the extraction and have to be fixed. I haven't run into too many hiccups with this but there is no guarantee that this will be the case for every filing type.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking why I am doing this method if there are these drawbacks. Well, I find I have a little bit more control over the process when it comes to leveraging patterns in the HTML code. These patterns, will help us be able to find section headers, titles and other \"meaningful\" components of the page that will give us context as to what it contains. This wills serve to be useful down the road when we want to look for very specfic parts of a paragraph."
