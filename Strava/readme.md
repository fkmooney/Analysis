## Purpose
Creating custom analytics and visualizations based on activty data exported from Strava. Strava allows for the export of GPX files, which contain the tracking data for individual activities. By analyzing this using Python, we can create custom insights not found through Strava's interface.

There are multiple Jupyter Notebooks that perfrom different analyses. <br>
For example, one maps previous rides:<br>

There is also a web app located at https://kempton.pythonanywhere.com

## Things to do
Show pregression of Personal Bests

### For aggregated feeds

improvement over time for same rides:
 - avg speed <br>
 - zone analysis <br>
 - distance vs date scatter plot with size for elevation gain<br>

 - A GitHub style calendar showing daily distance in kilometres.<br>
 - Each run is a circle. Run distance is mapped to circle area. speed is color<br>
 - annual retrospective<br>
 - maxes and totals for year<br>
