### For aggregated feeds

improvement over time for same rides:
 - avg speed <br>
 - zone analysis <br>
 - distance vs date scatter plot with size for elevation gain<br>
 
### Inspiration:

A GitHub style calendar showing daily distance in kilometres.<br>
Each run is a circle. Run distance is mapped to circle area. speed is color<br>
plot on map every strava route starting from home<br>
