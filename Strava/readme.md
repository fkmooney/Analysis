## Purpose
Creating custom analytics and visualizations based on activty data exported from Strava. Strava allows for the export of GPX files, which contain the tracking data for individual activities. By analyzing this using Python, we can create custom insights not found through Strava's interface.

## Things to do

create web interface:<br> 
 - have template site on https://kempton.pythonanywhere.com/ <br>
 - can load graphs to page using testplt.py <br>
 - need to put html structure together to hold graphs <br>

### For aggregated feeds

improvement over time for same rides:
 - avg speed <br>
 - zone analysis <br>
 - distance vs date scatter plot with size for elevation gain<br>

 - A GitHub style calendar showing daily distance in kilometres.<br>
 - Each run is a circle. Run distance is mapped to circle area. speed is color<br>
 - plot on map every strava route starting from home<br>
 - annual retrospective<br>
 - maxes and totalsfor year<br>
