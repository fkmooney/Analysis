# Making 3d Relief Maps

create relief maps with Blender, open source 3d animation studio (Blender ahs been downloaded)

Data Sources:
 Good source of nicer looking old maps: https://www.loc.gov/item/73697195/
Can get old topo maps from: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/
Get elevation data to create hegihmap: https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep
international elevation from here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/elevation/copernicus-dem/elevation

Inspriation:
COlored Jpana map using QGIS and Blender: https://github.com/joewdavies/geoblender
Scott Reinhard  take ideas and applies to vintage maps: see Amazing place

3 part lesson on vitage map (Uses argis, not QGIS) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=390MLX1Wuwk

Basic Process without blender:
1. get old topo
2. Assign coordinates to old maps in QGIS using Raster: Georeferencer (use this to open old topo)
3. create a new layer and open output from above in new layer
4. add esri topo layer
5. make old map layer transparent
6. play with properties like gamma of esri to make more dramatic


Blender Process:
Dan Hoffman Tutorial create elevation map from heightmap: https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/creating-shaded-relief-in-blender/

1. get old topo
2. get elevation data from USGS, may need several tiles
3. import into qgis
4. follow dan hoffman instructions, remember to:
	- reproject
	- output files should be less than 1 million kb tiff files
5. import height map into blender template file (from finger lakes)
6. add topo from qgis to it
7. check setting per dan hoffman instructions
8 render image
9 save image
10. Use gimp to past new relieft over old map in old topo file.
	First scale up layer a little to have room to transform it. If render of new releif has extra border, can use that to ensure old map is covered up
	then use scale to get to rigth size
	if necessary, trim border off new render, but dont crop as that changes size of layer
	then use Cage Transform to adjust for projection. need to move visible map over old, which may entail moving cage points further than you might think
	cage transform can leave artifacts, so can select those and remove them.
	Finally, use path  tool to draw a thick border around render to cover up issues.
